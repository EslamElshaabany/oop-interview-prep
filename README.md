# OOP Notes for Engineers

These are practical OOP notes I keep for myself and teammates.

The focus is simple: make design choices easier to explain and easier to maintain.

## Audience assumptions
- You already ship production code.
- You know the basics of OOP.
- You want concise notes with practical examples.

## How to use this repository
1. Read `01` to `05` as a concept refresher.
2. Use `06` for design heuristics.
3. Use `07` as discussion prompts.
4. Use `08` as a small design walkthrough.

## Revision checklist
- [ ] Explain OOP in terms of boundaries and change isolation.
- [ ] Discuss where inheritance hurts and where it still helps.
- [ ] Defend interface vs abstract class using real trade-offs.
- [ ] Explain polymorphism, dispatch, and overloading pitfalls clearly.
- [ ] Use SOLID as heuristics, not dogma.
- [ ] Tie design decisions to maintenance cost and team velocity.

## 1-hour refresh loop
- 20 min: read sections 01–05
- 15 min: run through section 07 out loud
- 25 min: walk section 08 and propose extensions

If you can explain the trade-offs clearly without hand-waving, the notes did their job.
